    <h1>All About Exploria üó∫Ô∏è</h1>
    <p class="aboutapp">As humans, we have an innate sense of curiosity, which is why traveling is important. Not only is traveling fun, but it is educational and can potentially be life changing.</p>
    <p class="aboutapp">However, there are a lot of people who want to travel that don't have any travel experience. Where are those of us supposed to start?</p>
    <p class="aboutapp">If you're new to travel and looking to start crossing things off your bucket list, Exploria is for you. It's the perfect place to begin planning your future travel adventures - your adventure can begin right here in the U.S.</p>
    <p class="aboutapp">Exploria provides information about the top 10 travel destination cities in the U.S. including, tips, tricks and the top tourist spots in those cities. This is all any new explorer could need when planning visits to the U.S cities on their travel bucket lists.</p>
    <p class="aboutapp">As a new explorer, you'll want to keep track of the places you've been and the places you still want to go. With Exploria, you can add destinations to your "Explored" or "Unexplored" list. You can also include a comment or two about the desination as well! For example, when adding a destination to your Explored list, you can add a note about your favorite part of that trip. Or, if you're adding a destination to your Unexplored list and there is something you want to do on that trip, you can add a comment to remind yourself!</p>
    <p class="aboutapp">Lastly, Exploria also provides you with a new quote each time you visit the Search page. Words - like travel - can inspire us. As Albus Dumbledore once said, "Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic." </p>
    <p class="aboutapp">Ultimately, Exploria is here to inspire, encourage and help make your adventures go as smoothly as possible.</p>
    <p class="endabout">There's an explorer inside us all.</p>
    <h3>Happy exploring!</h3>
