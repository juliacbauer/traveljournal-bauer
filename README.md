"Exploria" is a MongoDB MVC travel journal app.

It is designed for people who have little travel experience but want to start exploring. Exploria provides information about the top 10 U.S. cities as a starting point for the user. They can search from the list of 10 cities and read about them, learn about the main attractions and make note of the helpful tip. The search also pulls data from the OpenWeatherMap API to display the city's current weather.

After a user searches for information about a city, they can add it to their favorites list if they want to travel there. 

The Favorites page displays a user's saved favorite cities. The user can also delete the city from their favorites.

I was inspired to create this app because I love traveling, and I think travel is something everyone should experience. You don't have to fly across the world to experience the wonders of travel. Traveling within the U.S. - even if it is just a state over - can be fun, educational and potentially life changing.
